<h2 id="or-mastering-the-first-10-minutes-of-a-review">or “Mastering the first 10 minutes of a review”</h2>

<p>Doing a good review can take several hours.
So reviewers will check whether a submitted paper is worth their time and effort.
According to a checklist (by Electronical Journal
  of Knowlegde Management, <a href="http://www.ejkm.com/main.html">EJKM</a>), a reviewer should spend <strong>10 to 20 minutes to decide whether
  a paper is worth</strong> the effort of a detailed review or not. Other journals have similar guidelines for their reviewers. So every reviewer
will likely do this judgement by doing the following steps
(whether this is done consciously or unconsciously).</p>

<ol>
  <li>A reviewer will examine the <strong>title</strong> whether it is understandable</li>
  <li>A reviewer will read the <strong>abstract</strong> to figure out whether it is a clear and understandable summary</li>
  <li>A reviewer will skim-read the <strong>introduction</strong> to figure our whether the paper promises interesting aspects</li>
  <li>A reviewer will skip to the <strong>conclusion</strong> and <strong>summary</strong> to see what is the benefit of this paper</li>
  <li>A reviewer will scan the <strong>references</strong> to see that there is a reasonable amount of work behind the research</li>
</ol>

<p>There exist several online sources helping you to outline convincing papers. E.g. the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="http://writing.wisc.edu/Handbook/PlanResearchPaper.html">Writing a research paper</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://www.colby.edu/biology/BI17x/writing_papers.html">A guide to writing scientific papers</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3178846/">How to write your research papers</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://www.thewritesource.com/apa/apa.pdf">Sample APA research paper</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://conferences.sigcomm.org/co-next/2006/files/pres/10tipsforwritingapaper.pdf">Top-10 tips for writing a paper</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://custom-writing.org/blog/how-to-write-research-paper">How to Write a Research Paper in 6 Steps: The Ultimate Guide</a></li>
</ul>

<p>But I try to summarize some key findings and more detailed online sources how to convince a reviewer in his or her first 10 minutes reviewing your paper by paying special attention to a papers <em>title</em>, <em>abstract</em>, <em>introduction</em> and <em>conclusion and summary</em>.</p>

<h2 id="how-to-write-a-convincing-title">How to write a convincing title</h2>

<p>A title is a super summary of your paper. Although intended audience are undergraduate students, I find <a href="http://www.lsa.umich.edu/UMICH/sweetland/Home/Undergraduate/Writing%20Guides/HowDoIWriteaGreatTitle.pdf">Howto write a Great Title</a> useful to create interesting titles for paper submission.</p>

<p>I try to figure out some essential points. A good title should be composed of a <em>hook</em>, a set of <em>key terms</em> and a <em>source</em> (or location, domain).</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>The	hook</strong> is	often a	catchy,	readable phrase	that	advertises	the	paper’s	specific	subject.</li>
  <li><strong>Key terms</strong> are	crucial	words	or phrases with a specific meaning in a particular domain.	The	use	ofkey	terms	in	a	paper’s	title	will	make	the	paper	more searchable	in research paper	databases.</li>
  <li><strong>The source</strong> (or “location”)	is the domain	where	the	concepts
under	discussion have a specific meaning (e.g. a process is something different for an operating system specialist and a product engineer).</li>
</ul>

<p><br /></p>
<center>
<strong>Example:</strong>
<br />
<em>
The Effects of Light	and	Temperature	on the Growth of Populations of	the	Bacterium 'Escherichia coli'
</em>
</center>
<p><br /></p>

<p><strong>Explanation:</strong> The	hook	in	a	science
paper	is	often	simply	a	highly	relevant	but	exciting	and	direct	introduction	of	a	new	approach	or	discovery (in this case “The effect of … on …”).	The hook is	often combined using a	catalog	of	key	terms	relevant to a domain. Here	we	see	a	number	of	key	terms:	“light”,	“temperature”,	“growth”, and	the	“bacterium”.	Therefore, the	title	would	be	highly	searchable	and	is	very	informative.	The	final	part is the	source	which	clearly	identifies	the	bacterium	under	discussion (“Escheria coli”).</p>

<h2 id="howto-write-a-convincing-abstract-in-six-sentences">Howto write a convincing abstract <small>in six sentences</small></h2>

<p>Because research databases contain only abstracts, it is vital to write a meaningful description of your paper to entice other researchers obtaining the full paper which could increase your citation rate.
Writing a convincing abstract is the most challenging part of a paper for me.
You should not simply copy your summary or conclusion.
Maybe you want to write your abstract in six sentences, according to this very helpfull <a href="http://www.easterbrook.ca/steve/2010/01/how-to-write-a-scientific-abstract-in-six-easy-steps/">howto</a> (in my eyes).
It should cover <em>backgorund, purpose, methods used, findings, conclusion</em>.</p>

<p>Hopefully, I took the essentials from it (but you may want to check all the links provided below).</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Introduce your paper in one sentence</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Simply answer the question <em>“What’s the topic?”</em></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>State the problem you tackle in one sentence.</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>What’s the key research question?</li>
      <li>Remember, your first sentence introduced the overall topic, so now you can build on that.</li>
      <li>Focus on one key question within that topic.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Summarize (in one sentence) why nobody else has adequately answered the research question yet.</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>The trick is to explain that there’s this one particular approach that nobody else tried yet.</li>
      <li>But here you’re phrasing it in such a way that it’s clear it’s a gap in the literature.</li>
      <li>So use a phrase such as “previous work did not address …”.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Explain, in one sentence, how you tackled the research question.</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>What’s your big new idea? What’s the new perspective you have adopted?</li>
      <li>What’s your overall view on the question you introduced in step 2?</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>In one sentence, how did you go about doing the research that follows from your big idea.</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Did you run experiments? Build a piece of software? Carry out case studies?</li>
      <li>This is likely to be the longest sentence</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>As a single sentence, what’s the key impact of your research?</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Here reader is not looking for the outcome of an experiment.</li>
      <li>Reader is looking for a summary of the implications.</li>
      <li>What’s it all mean? Why should other people care? What can they do with your research.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>

<h2 id="howto-write-a-convincing-introduction-telling-a-story">Howto write a convincing introduction <small>telling a story</small></h2>

<p>According to these <a href="http://conferences.sigcomm.org/co-next/2006/files/pres/10tipsforwritingapaper.pdf">tips</a> every paper should tell a story. So introduce the story by</p>

<ul>
  <li>presenting new ideas</li>
  <li>giving new insights</li>
  <li>and answer the question why is it important or interesting (universal truth, hot topic, suprises, unexpected results)?</li>
</ul>

<p>using the following general <a href="http://conferences.sigcomm.org/co-next/2006/files/pres/10tipsforwritingapaper.pdf">outline proposal</a> for writing an introduction.
It is like a micro structure, you likely find in a lot of introductions.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Paragraph 1:</strong> What is the problem area and why it is important?</li>
  <li><strong>Paragraph 2:</strong> What is the specific problem in the problem area.</li>
  <li><strong>Paragraph 3:</strong> Tell the elevator pitch.</li>
  <li><strong>Paragraph 4:</strong> How is your story different, better, relates to other work</li>
  <li><strong>Paragraph 5:</strong> Explain your outline. The famous “The remainder of this paper is structured as follows …” Normally it covers related work, research methodology, evaluation, future work and conclusion (some of these sections can be combined)</li>

<h2 id="howto-write-a-convincing-conclusion-as-take-aways">Howto write a convincing conclusion <small>as take aways</small></h2>

<p>Nobody is really interested in your research outcomes, if you
are not willing to present the essential facts and outcomes in a take away form.
Maybe it is a good strategy to conclude your article according to “<a href="http://patthomson.wordpress.com/2012/04/06/concluding-the-journal-article/">Concluding the journal article</a>”.
I tried to figure out the essentials.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Paragraph 1: Summarize your paper to remind the reader why the article was written.</strong> At the beginning you will have argued that there is a space in what is known, a puzzle that needs to be solved, a debate that is continuing, or an issue that deserves discussion. The writer will have promised to fill the space, solve the puzzle, contribute to the debate or participate in the discussion. The writer should use the argument made for the need for the article to present the case that this is what they’ve done.</li>
  <li><strong>Paragraph 2: Reprise the argument that has been made in introduction without repeating it boringly.</strong> Try to keep your conclusion a déjà vu free zone.</li>
  <li><strong>Paragraph 3: Deal with the <em>So What</em>, <em>Now What</em> and <em>Who cares</em> questions?</strong> You should not leave the answers to these questions to chance, assuming that any sensible reader will be able to work them out for themselves. The conclusion must tell the reader how and why the presented is significant for practice, policy or further research. It should be made obvious for the reader how the article provides a contribution to knowledge and what implications for further research or action can be derived.</li>
  <li><strong>Paragraph 4: Conclude but avoid clichés.</strong> It’s pretty easy to round off an article with a few pious sentiments. While some tired phrases won’t cause your article to be rejected, it will leave the reader with almost no lasting impression. As the conclusion is the last thing that the reader will encounter, its important that they finish with the things that you want them to remember.</li>
